                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Scope var has function-level scope. It means that a variable declared with var is visible throughout
                        the function in which
                        it is declared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hoisting Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. However,
                        only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reassignment var allows for redeclaration and
                        reassignment of
                        variables.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span>Block Scope </span>
                        let has block-level scope. It means that a variable declared with let is only accessible within
                        the block it is
                        declared in (if, for, while, etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hoisting Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their block but are not initialized.
                        Accessing the
                        variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reassignment let allows reassignment but not redeclaration of the same variable within the same block scope.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-base font-bold text-[#c51b46]">*CONST</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Block Scope const also has block-level scope.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hoisting like let, variables declared with const are hoisted to the top of their block but are not initialized. Accessing
                        the variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reassignment Variables declared with const must be initialized during declaration and cannot be reassigned. However, for
                        objects and arrays, while the reference cannot be changed, the internal properties or elements of the
                        object/array can be modified.

                <p>
                    An API, or application programming interface, is a set of
                    rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is
                    an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural
                    style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs. </p>
